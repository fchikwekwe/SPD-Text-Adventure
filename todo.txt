Text adventure game


write full narrative
Separate narrative passages into encounters
Item inventory system
CRUD player character
Add SQL lite database to store saves
Add tKinter GUI so game is playable outside of command line
Deploy to Heroku (or another similar site?) so game is playable remotely
Maybe post game on itch.io
