Goal of the game--
Introduce the main character. Acquaint the players with their struggles and take them on a journey out of the city. Introduce other characters within the game as well.

Scene = A city which has been devastated by an ongoing war. There are frequent bombings that make it difficult to get out of the house at all. As a result, many of your neighbors have fled, starved to death or died trying to get additional supplies.

Main character = Oldest of four children. Mid/late 20s. Your parents were killed in the corner store that they kept a few months ago during a heavy afternoon of bombings. Since their death, you've taken responsibility for your siblings.

You have worked for a local transportation agency for the past two years and they are shutting down in this city now due to the bombings. Your boss was very fond of you, so as severance, you were given a final task: deliver supplies to a hospital in a nearby city. This is good news for you because it means that you gain access to a minivan to get your family out of the city. This neighboring city is reported to be much safer than your current location. There are four in your family, so you have three more seats to potentially offer to others in need.

You will encounter six characters besides your family members who would like to leave the city. You job is to talk to them and decide if you want to save them or leave them behind. Choose wisely. You can only fit three more people in the car and you may not be able to go back for those who do not take with you.

Alia = Sister. Age 11. Bold, passionate and opinionated. After your parents died, she has become more and more outspoken about things she disagrees with. You worry her mouth will get her in trouble.

Raya = Sister. Age 8. Patient, optimistic and curious. She would rather go back to the days on studying bugs as they crawl across the pavement. Now, she studies chips of paint on the wall and traces her name in the dirt floor.

Omar = Brother. Age 22. Quiet, brave and impulsive. Always puts others before himself, even at his own peril. He leaves the house for supplies, even on days when it isn't safe to go out. You can tell he feels trapped by the war.
