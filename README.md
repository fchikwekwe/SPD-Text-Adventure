This is a text-based adventure game with branching narrative elements. Currently, the project just includes the first chapter of the story. Overall, this story is designed to be about 4-5 chapters long. The game itself was built in Python.

This project is currently playable in the command line, but I have added a class where I am working on integrating a GUI with tkinter to make the game more accessible.

Feel free to play and enjoy. Please reach out if you have any questions.
